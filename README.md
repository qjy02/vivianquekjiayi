## 🎯 About This Project

This is my personal corner designed to feel calm, warm, and intentional.

It serves as:
- A portfolio
- An introduction to who I am as a software developer
- ~Listen to music~

This project began as an exploration of Nuxt.js and Vue.js, drawn by how calm and visually pleasing the developer experience felt—especially with the built-in DevTools that made designing the interface intuitive and fun. 

It was built with Nuxt 3 to experiment with server-rendered Vue applications, file-based routing, and modern frontend workflows.
